        "In this competition, our aim is to predict which LLM responses users will prefer in a head-to-head battle between chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs). In other words, the goal of the competition is to predict the preferences of the judges and determine the likelihood that a given prompt/response pair is selected as the winner. This notebook will guide you through the process of fine-tuning the **DebertaV3** model for this competition using the **Shared Weight** strategy with KerasNLP. This strategy is similar to how Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) models are trained. Additionally, we will use mixed precision for faster training and inference.\n",

        "**Did you know**: This notebook is backend-agnostic, which means it supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX backends. However, the best performance can be achieved with `JAX`. KerasNLP and Keras enable the choice of the preferred backend. Explore further details on [Keras](https://keras.io/keras_3/).\n",

Imported or craft beer kegs can range from $150-$300+ depending on brand.\\n\\n- At a brewery - Buying directly from a local brewery in San Jose, a 15.5 gallon keg may cost $100-$250 depending on the brand. Some breweries offer discounts when you provide and pay a deposit on the keg upfront.\\n\\n- From a beer distributor - Commercial beer distributors that supply bars\\\\/restaurants may offer kegs for cheaper than retail, perhaps $80-$200 for a domestic beer and $150-$250 for craft beer. You often need to order in higher quantities to get distributor pricing.\\n\\n- Deposit - Most places require a refundable deposit on the keg itself that is returned when you bring back the keg, which is usually $30-$100. \\n\\n- Taxes - Depending on the laws, certain taxes may also be added to the base price.\\n\\nSo in summary, a basic domestic beer keg in San Jose from a store may be $130-$180 out the door. But a keg of popular craft beer could be $200+ when factoring in all costs. Reaching out to local breweries or beer distributors directly may get you better pricing.\",\n          \"Illusion binds us,\\nReality's truth unveiled,\\nMind bends, world transforms.\",\n          \"Subject: Embracing Change: Navigating Through Our Current Transition\\n\\nDear [Recipient's Name],\\n\\nI trust this message finds you well.

At the same time, it is also important to acknowledge the biological differences between males and females.\\n\\nOne possible approach to finding a middle ground could be to focus on respecting individuals' self-identification and autonomy while also acknowledging the biological differences between males and females. This could involve using inclusive language that reflects individuals' gender identities while also recognizing the importance of biological sex in certain contexts, such as medical treatment and reproductive health.\\n\\nIt may also be helpful to explore ways to create a more inclusive society where individuals of all gender identities are valued and respected. This could involve promoting education and awareness about gender diversity and creating policies and practices that support individuals' gender identities and expression.\\n\\nUltimately, the goal of mediation is to find a solution that meets the needs and concerns of both parties. By focusing on mutual respect, open communication, and a willingness to find common ground, it is possible to reach a resolution that allows both parties to move forward in a positive and productive way.\",\n          \"When you want to initialize the classification head for transfer learning, you can follow these steps:\\n\\n  1. Load the pre-trained model: First, load the pre-trained vision transformer model on ImageNet. You can use popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow to load the model.\\n  2. Freeze the pre-trained layers: Next, you need to freeze the pre-trained layers of the model so that they don't get updated during the training process. This is because the pre-trained layers have learned useful features that can be reused for the new task.\\n  3. Add a new classification head: Now, you need to add a new classification head to the model. The classification head is responsible for outputting the predicted class for a given input image. The size of the classification head depends on the number of classes in the new task. For example, if you are working on the StanfordCars dataset, which has 196 classes, you would need a classification head with 196 output neurons.\\n  4. Initialize the classification head: Initialize the weights of the classification head randomly or using pre-trained weights. This is important because the initial weights can have a significant impact on the performance of the model.\\n  5. Train the model: Finally, you can train the model on the new task using your labeled data. During training, only the weights of the classification head will be updated, while the weights of the frozen pre-trained layers will remain unchanged. This allows the model to learn task-specific features while leveraging the pre-trained features.\\n\\nNote that there are different ways to initialize the classification head, such as using Xavier initialization, Kaiming initialization, or He initialization. You can choose the initialization method that works best for your specific task and model architecture.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"You still have three oranges. Eating an orange yesterday does not affect the number of oranges you have today.\",\n          \"Mr Reddy and Ms Blue both have valid points in their arguments. On one hand, Mr Reddy is correct that women are adult human females, as defined by their biological and physical characteristics. However, Ms Blue is right that gender is a more fluid concept and that people can identify with any gender they choose. A compromise could be that gender is defined by an individual's self-identification, while sex is defined by their biological characteristics.\",\n          \"To initialize the classification head when performing transfer learning, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Load the pre-trained vision transformer model that was trained on ImageNet.\\n2. Replace the existing classification head with a new one suitable for the StanfordCars dataset.\\n3. Initialize the weights of the new classification head with random values or pre-trained weights if available.\\n4. Freeze the weights of the vision transformer backbone to prevent them from being updated during training.\\n5. Train the model on the StanfordCars dataset, fine-tuning the classification head while keeping the backbone frozen.\\n\\nHere's an example implementation in Python using PyTorch:\\n\\n```python\\nimport torch\\nimport torch.nn as nn\\nimport torchvision.models as models\\n\\n# Step 1: Load pre-trained vision transformer model\\nvision_transformer = models.vit_base_patch16_224(pretrained=True)\\n\\n# Step 2: Replace classification head\\nnum_classes = 196  # Number of classes in StanfordCars dataset\\nvision_transformer.head = nn.Linear(vision_transformer.head.in_features, num_classes)\\n\\n# Step 3: Initialize weights of new classification head\\nnn.init.xavier_uniform_(vision_transformer.head.weight)\\nnn.init.constant_(vision_transformer.head.bias, 0)\\n\\n# Step 4: Freeze the weights of the backbone\\nfor param in vision_transformer.parameters():\\n    param.requires_grad = False\\n\\n# Step 5: Train the model on StanfordCars dataset\\n# ...\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we load the pre-trained vision transformer model using `torchvision.models.vit_base_patch16_224`. We then replace the `head` (classification head) of the model with a new linear layer (`nn.Linear`) that has the appropriate number of output classes for the StanfordCars dataset.\\n\\nAfter replacing the classification head, we initialize its weights using Xavier initialization (`nn.init.xavier_uniform_`) and set its biases to zero (`nn.init.constant_`).\\n\\nFinally, we freeze the weights of the vision transformer backbone by setting `requires_grad=False` for all parameters. This ensures that only the weights of the classification head will be updated during training on the StanfordCars dataset.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The couple is required to meet certain criteria, such as being of a certain age or not being closely related. Once the license is issued, there's often a waiting period before the marriage ceremony can take place. The marriage license has to be signed by the couple, their witnesses, and the officiant conducting the marriage ceremony, then returned to the license issuer for recording.\\n\\n2. Marriage Certificate: A marriage certificate, on the other hand, is a document that proves a marriage has legally taken place. It's issued after the marriage ceremony, once the signed marriage license has been returned and recorded. The marriage certificate includes details about the couple, like their names, the date and location of their wedding, and the names of their witnesses. This document serves as the official record of the marriage and is often needed for legal transactions like changing a name, adding a spouse to insurance, or proving marital status.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"winner_model_a\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"winner_model_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"winner_tie\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"winner_model_b\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"encode_fail\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"options\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "\n",
        "**Why it's important:** Initially, raw text data is complex and challenging for modeling due to its high dimensionality. By converting text into a compact set of tokens, such as transforming `\"The quick brown fox\"` into `[\"the\", \"qu\", \"##ick\", \"br\", \"##own\", \"fox\"]`, we simplify the data. Many models rely on special tokens and additional tensors to understand input. These tokens help divide input and identify padding, among other tasks. Making all sequences the same length through padding boosts computational efficiency, making subsequent steps smoother.\n",

While this notebook focuses on `DebertaV3`, you can explore others in the [KerasNLP documentation](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/models/). For a deeper understanding, refer to the [getting started guide](https://keras.io/guides/keras_nlp/getting_started/).\n",

This means we provide the model with one response at a time along with the prompt `(P + R_A)`, `(P + R_B)`, etc., using the same model weights for all responses. After obtaining embeddings for all responses, we concatenate them and apply average pooling. Next, we use a `Linear/Dense` layer along with the `Softmax` function as the classifier for the final result. Providing all responses at once would increase text length and complicate model handling. Note that, in the classifier, we use 3 classes for `winner_model_a`, `winner_model_b`, and `draw` cases.\n",
